# Use Gate Order

## Updated for 1.0

**IMPORTANT INFO:** this is a modded version of Fleet Jump Order (Order Chain Lib ver.) so if you're using that mod you have to swap it for this one.

Makes it possible to order ships to use gates and wormholes.   
Only works for the sector the ship is currently located in though.
